> 🧩 A structured, bilingual AI Security learning system —  
> built to connect **AI Safety, Risk Management, and Cybersecurity** into one coherent framework.

---

## ⚙️ Powered By

- 🧱 **Obsidian 1.9+** for structure and MathJax rendering  
- 🤖 **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** for assisted content generation  
- 🧩 **Markdown + MathJax** for explainable documentation  
- 🔐 **Security Frameworks:** NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, OWASP ML Top-10, MITRE ATLAS  

---

## 🌍 Overview

This repository is a **personal AI Security learning framework**, designed to integrate topics like  
**AI Safety, Model Risk, Adversarial ML, Governance, PKI, and Cloud Security**  
into a single, structured, and explainable system.

It’s built as a **research-grade learning environment** — not a simple note collection,  
but a living vault that evolves as I study and experiment.

---

## 💡 Purpose

- 📚 To **learn AI Security deeply and systematically** (from trust foundations to GenAI threats)  
- 🤖 To **connect Cloud Security, PKI, and AI Risk Management** into a unified perspective  
- 🧩 To **create bilingual educational material** — English for clarity, Hungarian for reflection  
- ⚙️ To experiment with **AI-assisted automation**, Obsidian workflows, and self-improving vaults

## 🧭 Structure

```text
00_Foundations/                       → Core AI Security concepts, trust, lifecycle, learning path
01_Attack_Taxonomy_and_Threats/       → Threat surfaces, MITRE ATLAS–style taxonomy, attack classes
02_Defenses_and_Mitigations/          → Preventive controls, hardening, robustness, privacy defenses
03_Attack_Detection_and_Response/     → Monitoring, anomaly detection, incident handling for AI systems
04_Secure_Deployment_and_Governance/  → Model release, signing, audit logging, compliance & governance
05_AI_Risk_Management_and_Assurance/  → NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, risk registers, assurance & controls
06_AI_Safety_and_Ethical_Assurance/   → Fairness, explainability, human-in-the-loop, accountability
07_AI_Security_Automation_and_Metrics/→ Security-as-Code, Policy-as-Code, telemetry, KPIs, automation
08_Generative_AI_Security/            → RAG security, prompt injection, watermarking, GenAI supply chain
99_Glossary/                          → Cross-linked core concepts (EN/HU glossary)
```

Each section is bilingual (🇬🇧 English + 🇭🇺 Hungarian) and formatted for  
**Obsidian 1.9+ MathJax** — including formulas, lineage links, and visual cues.

## 🔗 Standards and Frameworks

This Vault aligns with:

- **NIST AI RMF 1.0**
    
- **ISO/IEC 42001:2023**
    
- **EU AI Act – Risk-based Governance**
    
- **MITRE ATLAS & OWASP ML Top 10**
    
- **Zero-Trust for AI Systems**

## ⚖️ Ethics & Compliance

This project contains **only educational and research content**.  
No proprietary, confidential, or organization-specific data is included.  
All examples and architectures are **theoretical** or **publicly documented** sources.

---

## 📈 Learning Roadmap

> I’m currently transitioning from PKI & Cloud Security engineering  
> to a full AI Security & Governance specialization.

Planned progression:

1. 🧩 Complete theory (AI Security Vault — current stage)
    
2. ⚙️ Build lab environments (adversarial testing, model validation, RAG pipelines) 
    
3. 🧠 Apply for AI Security Engineer / Architect roles
    
4. 🧾 Contribute to open-source frameworks and research
    

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

-  Add practical labs (adversarial attack demos, prompt injection tests)
    
-  Expand Automation & Metrics with CI/CD guardrails
    
-  Publish bilingual mini-guides for explainability & fairness
